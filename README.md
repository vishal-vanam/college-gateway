Vision: The College Gateway is an online platform where educational seekers meet educational providers. It mainly focuses on aspirants who wanted to build their career towards their goals by providing information about colleges and universities (admission flow, ratings and qualifications required), examinations and a result predictor. There are many online sites but not even a few have been successful in reaching and making the education seekers build up their career options in an interactive way. This is a project focusing for a user friendly environment with all the necessary information and guidelines for educational seekers choosing their career.  

With the literature survey, stating that not many of the below objectives being available on a single online platform. 
  o Free of Cost. Certain web based applications such as Career-Guide charge for the usage, so present web based application aims to           provide free access to client ease of usage.
  o Updated information day to day. Certain features like cut-off of colleges and up-date information of exams need to be focused             for which the present application provides updated information. 
  o Advanced College Search through location search. Clients who are interested for certain colleges based on the geographical location       are indeed be well benefited by the website as it mainly focuses for user-friendly search.
  o Not limited to specific region Unlike few web application which are centric to certain boundary or country, the project primarily         focuses on study-abroad programs. 
  o Featured Colleges As to focus on quicker response time, the application initially focuses on a few featured colleges, where at later       stage deals with a huge data with a few optimizations featuring it.  
  
Hopefully, College Gateway would definitely reach out to those problems and many other. The novel of the project is Newsfeeds relevant to the user search with a less complex point to point view. 

Software Architecture: The project is dealt with python using Django framework in Ubuntu OS besides using HTML, CSS, JS for front-end and MySQL/POSTgre SQL for back-end. There are more or less a few python modules in Django framework but here are a few frequently used modules: admin for admin, auth for authentication module, redirects used as an anchor module, sessions for storing anonymous data, sites for multiple websites operation for same shared database and some other like settings etc …. As it is a engineering project (never ending for idealization and development), and even better to get more efficient database management and fine user interface, giving us more scope of technical advancement and more over it is our first real world product, so always be focused and interested.   

Challenges and Risk: The main challenging problem in the project is the creation of environment and the packages (dealt before like POSTgre SQL is default in Django but we are 
good in MySQL so creation of separate environment and necessary packages) as it is the most time consuming task besides efficient database management system. The risk can be minimized by learning usage of environmental configurations.
